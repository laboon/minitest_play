# magic_ball_test.rb

# This is a MiniTest test file.  It will test the MagicBall object in magic_ball.rb
# The two main testing libraries in Ruby are Minitest and RSpec.
# Minitest is simpler and more similar to most popular testing frameworks
# like JUnit and cppunit, but if you are interested, RSpec is worth checking out.

# Minitest documentation here: http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/

# require can be used to access gems (i.e. libraries)
# Libraries tend to be used very often in Ruby programs and especially Rails projects
# Note that you can add a .rb or not; generally Ruby devs will not do so

require 'minitest/autorun'
require_relative 'magic_ball'

# This shows subclassing in action!  MagicBallTest is a subclass of Minitest::Test
# This would be similar to:
# import Minitest.Test;
# public class MagicBallTest extends Test { ... }


class MagicBallTest < Minitest::Test

  # Methods that start with "test", and are in classes which are subclasses
  # of Minitest::Test, will be run as tests when you run this file.
  # Be careful - a common error is writing "tset_whatever" and that test
  # will never run!  This is one of the problems with an interpreted language
  # like Ruby.

  # Just like manual tests, we should always code up EXPECTED behavior in our
  # test cases, not OBSERVED behavior.  The execution of the test will determine
  # the observed behavior.  If expected behavior is not equal to the observed
  # behavior, we have a failure.

  # Verify that creating a MagicBall is an instance of MagicBall and not
  # something else.
  # Assertions are how we declare that something is correct with our code.
  # They should state the EXPECTED BEHAVIOR of the system (usually a method,
  # object, or class)
  # assert by itself checks that the following statement returns true
  # refute by itself would check that the following statement returns false

  end

  # Very simple test - check that creating a new MagicBall creates
  # a new MagicBall and verifies that it is not nil.
  # nil is similar to Java's null
  # refute can be read as "assert not" - that is, refute_nil would
  # be the same as the (nonexistent) "assert_not_nil"

  # assert_includes means "assert that the result exists in the array
  # MagicBall::ANSWERS.
  # You can obtain a constant/class variable using ::, which we have been
  # doing for ::new but is also available for other things
  # This calls the ask method on a new MagicBall the question "Meow?"
  # This should return a string which should be something in MagicBall::ANSWERS
